# Ercot-Grid-Data-Visualization
Python script to visualize frequency oscillation points in the Texas ERCOT power grid.

The script itself relies on a number of input files that can be found in the src folder.

What this program tries to accomplish:
  There are censors scattered across the Texas ERCOT power grid called 'buses'. These buses collect power grid frequency oscillation data.
  Each bus collects thousands of data points per day (roughly 4000), and it's important to visualize this data to get an understanding
  of the health of the grid. 

  To visualize this data, the Python script reads oscillation data for a given day and turns it into a video with a graph and a heat map
  of the state of Texas.
